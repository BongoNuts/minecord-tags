## Chase the Skies Drop
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This update is out now for Java and Bedrock. Please read <#656622314309550129> and <#991413145535000626> to see all the additions and changes.
## Vibrant Visuals
- Vibrant Visuals is Minecraft's biggest official visual enhancement - delivering a dazzling cosmetic upgrade with a new modern graphics pipeline and an array of visual improvements. Sunrises are more vivid, water reflects, forests become shaded, and more!
- Vibrant Visuals preserves what makes Minecraft uniquely special - pixelated shadows, caustics, and reflections have been carefully crafted to preserve and enhance Minecraft's signature blocky style
- With updated textures for blocks, items, and more that decide how different light sources interact with them, builds will become more vivid and visually interesting!
- Updated art settings and post-processing effects tie the visuals together in a signature Minecraft way
- As a cosmetic enhancement to the game, Vibrant Visuals does not impact Minecraft's gameplay, meaning you can play on Realms with friends whether they have Vibrant Visuals enabled or not (Realms subscription sold separately. Multiplayer functionality will require platform specific online subscriptions, also sold separately)
### Note
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marketplace content such as Resource Packs and Worlds are **NOT** compatible with Vibrant Visuals. Marketplace Add-Ons are compatible
### Java Edition
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please read this article on more information on when Vibrant Visuals will come to Java Edition: https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/vibrant-visuals-java-edition

If you don't know how to mark something as a spoiler, put double vertical bars around the text. So you will want to have || on either side of the text. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we see people blatantly posting spoilers of the film **anywhere** in the server to ruin the upcoming experience for others, we will take moderation action. <:warden:763094083785850911>
